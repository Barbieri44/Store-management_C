# Store-management_C
This project is a C-based program designed to manage a simple inventory and sales system. It acts as a basic point-of-sale and stock management tool for a small business.

The program uses structs to define products and sales, allowing it to store information such as product codes, names, prices, and stock quantities, as well as sales codes, quantities sold, and total sale values.

The project is written in Portuguese, as indicated by the use of setlocale(LC_ALL, "portuguese") and the text in the printf and scanf functions. This simple console application demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts, including data structures, functions, pointers, and user input/output handling. It provides a practical example of how these concepts can be combined to build a functional data management application.
